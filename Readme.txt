Objective: 

	The minPlanesRequirement algorithm calculates the minimum number of planes required to reach last airport i.e last index of array, where each value in the array represents the maximum index that can be covered from that position.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. Function Definition:

	The algorithm starts with defining the minPlanesRequirement function, which takes an array of integers (airport) as input and returns the minimum    number of planes required.

2. Initialization:

	Initialize variables maxCoverage, totalPlanes, and lastIndex.
	maxCoverage: To keep track of the maximum index reached from a given window.
	totalPlanes: To track the no of planes needed to reach the current index
	lastIndex: Last index of a window covered by the plane from current index
	Calculate the destinationIndex, which is the last index of the array (arr.length - 1).

3.Base Case Check:

	Check if the length of the array is 1. If it is, return 0 as no planes are needed to cover a single position.

4.Main Loop:

	Iterate through the array using a for loop, with the index starting from 0. 

5.Update Maximum Coverage:

	Update maxCoverage by taking the maximum value between the current maxCoverage and the sum of the current index and the value at that index in the 	array (Math.max(maxCoverage, index + arr[index])).

6.Plane Movement:

	a. If the current index equals lastIndex, it means a plane has reached the position which is possible through the fuel from the previos index.
        b. Update lastIndex to the current maxCoverage, indicating the last index reached by the plane from the previous window.
	c. Increment totalPlanes to track the total number of planes used.

7.Check Completion:

	If maxCoverage is beyond or equal to destinationIndex, return totalPlanes. This indicates that all positions till the end of the array have been 	covered.

8.Final Result:

	If it's not possible to reach the end of the array, return -1.


Complexity Analysis:

Time Complexity:
	The algorithm iterates through the array once. In each iteration, it performs constant-time operations. Hence, the time complexity is O(n), where n 	is the length of the input array.
Space Complexity:
	The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space for storing variables (maxCoverage, totalPlanes, lastIndex, and destinationIndex). Hence, the 	space complexity is O(1).

Final :  The minPlanesRequirement algorithm efficiently calculates the minimum number of planes required to reach last airport. It does so by tracking the maximum coverage reached by planes and incrementing the total number of planes used as they progress through the array. The algorithm has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1), making it an effective solution for this problem.
